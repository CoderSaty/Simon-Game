# Description

A simple and easy to use responsive website created using HTML5, CSS and jQuery to replicate an electronic simon game. Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
